This A/B testing analysis is based on a Harvard Business Review case study: https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/M347-PDF-ENG

Star Digital conducted an A/B testing to determine the effectiveness of their online marketing efforts.
The treatment group was shown Star Digital's online advertisement on six different websites, while the contorl group was not shown the ad.

This analysis aims to help Star Digital answer the following questions:
1) Is online advertising effective for Star Digital?
2) Is there a frequency effect of advertising on purchase? In particular, the question is whether increasing the frequency of advertising increases the probability of purchase?
3) Which sites should Star Digital advertise on? In particular, should it put its advertising dollars in Site 6 or in Sites 1 through 5?
